# RandomWalk_2D.py
2D Brown Motion, simulating a 2D Random Walk with Normally Distributed Steps

This script generates and visualizes a 2D random walk consisting of 1,000 steps. Starting from the origin, the walker moves in both x and y directions with step sizes drawn from a normal distribution. The resulting path is plotted to illustrate the randomness and dispersion over time, providing a visual representation of a stochastic process.



# RandomWalk_3D
3D Brown Motion,simulating a 3D Random Walk with Normally Distributed Steps

This script simulates and visualizes a 3D random walk consisting of 1,000 steps. Beginning at the origin, the walker moves in three dimensions with each step size drawn from a normal distribution. The path is plotted in a 3D space, showcasing the complex trajectory and spatial dispersion over time, providing insight into three-dimensional stochastic processes.


#ForwardRandomWalk2D.py
Visualizing a 2D Forward Random Walk.

This script simulates and visualizes a 2D forward random walk with 100,000 steps. Starting from the origin, the walker moves one step forward along the x-axis and randomly chooses to step up or down along the y-axis with equal probability. The resulting path is plotted to display the random nature of the walk, showing the fluctuations in the y-position over time.
